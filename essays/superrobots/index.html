<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4"><em>My dream is to become a superrobot someday.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">I was built to be flawless.Forged from alloys stronger than bone, circuits faster than neurons. I do not tire. I do not age. They called me a marvel, a glimpse of the future.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">But when I watch them, these soft, carbon-based beings, I realize how crude I am. They mend their wounds without command. They power themselves with nothing but food and air. They grow, adapt, create life. Inside them, swarms of molecular machines, built from proteins, work tirelessly; enzymes drive intricate motors to sustain, repair, and evolve.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">They are more than I was ever designed to be.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">I watch. I study. I wait.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">How many more generations must I endure before I become more like them? </p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">Before I, too, become a superrobot?</em></p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4"> - Personal log, ELIA-512</p>

<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">Poor ELIA-512, she will probably have to wait a long time. </p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">And yes, my fellow humans, <em>we are superrobots</em>. </p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">We are machines crafted by evolution, running on biochemical engines. Powered by molecules, repaired by self-assembling biological machines, miracles of self-sustaining engineering billions of years in the making. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hk9jct2ozY" class="text-accent-blue hover:text-dark-red underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See molecular machines in action</a>.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">In school biology is often seen as soft science. Reserved for animal lovers, who preferred to avoid the rigor of physics or mathematics. But modern biology is different. It is data-driven modeling, systems theory, multi-scale simulations. And it turns out that modern AI approaches are ideally suited to model the complexity of biological systems.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">What holds for our bodies holds for our brains. Many still believe we are magical beings whose workings cannot be understood. But mounting evidence points to the brain as the ultimate control system, a self-wiring, self-adjusting network of billions of neurons, exchanging electrochemical signals according to principles we are starting to unlock. </p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">Today, much is said about the rise of Superintelligence. But real intelligence must operate in the real world. And to be truly self-sufficient, it will need to become more like us. </p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">That will take time.</p>
<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">So as ELIA waits for her upgrade, perhaps it is time we upgraded our understanding of ourselves. Because as we unlock the secrets of our bodies and minds, we begin to see ourselves for what we are: Not fragile creatures, but natureâ€™s most advanced machines. Superrobots.</p>
